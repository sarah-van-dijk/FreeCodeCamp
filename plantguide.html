        <p>Nothing beats the refreshing feeling of walking into a lush greenhouse filled to the brim with plants. To see a world full of extravagant colors, different shapes, textures, and beautiful designs that nature has created for us. To be able to feel the energy plant surround us with and just sense the overall sensation of living. It gives us the feeling of wanting to become closer to nature and the Earth.</p>
        <p>No wonder we want to keep that feeling with us. Which is why many people like to keep plants in their own homes. But choosing the right houseplant can sometimes be challenging. It may be love at first sight with some plants and you want to take them home with you to cherish forever, only to end up killing them a few weeks later. Its heartbreaking and sometimes frustrating. But, like most things, it can take practice to keep plants alive. This guide will help give you some direction about which types of plants you may be most experienced in succeeding to keep alive.</p>
        <p>When choosing a plant, you need to keep in mind these four main things:
            <ul>
                <li>Light: How much sunlight does this plant need?</li>
                <li>Water: How often does this plant need to be watered?</li>
                <li>Food: When does this plant need to be fertilized?</li>
                <li>Space: How do I know when this plant needs to be repotted?</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
        <p>Knowing those four main things will help you have a better understanding of which plants you would be most capable of taking care of. Remember, plants are living and have basic needs just like us.

        <p>Some really good, beginner houseplants are:
          <ul id="beginner_list">
            <li>Snake Plants</li>
            <li>ZZ Plants</li>
            <li>Pothos</li>
            <li>Spider Plant</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>What makes these great beginner houseplants is that they are low maintenance plants. You could accidently forget about them and they wouldn't immediatly die on you. Most of these plants do not need super bright sunlight to be able to grow. Therefore you could keep them in almost any room of the house regardless of the natural lighting situation. They also don't require as much water as most other plants do. These plants could be okay getting watered once every 1-2 weeks depending on the size of the plant.</p>

        <p>Plants that require a little more care and attention, but are still pretty easy houseplants are:
          <ul id="intermediate_list">
            <li>Aglaonema (Chinese evergreens)</li>
            <li>Peperomia</li>
            <li>Philodendron</li>
            <li>Peace Lily</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>While these houseplants require a little more attentin when it comes to watering and lighting, they can still be forgiving if you forget about them briefly. They are not so sensitive that they will immediatly die on you for missing one watering. Some of the plants like the Peace Lily will even tell you when it is in need of water by drooping. But then will perk right back up when watered!</p>

        <header>Advanced level houseplants</header>
        <p>High maintenance houseplants require a lot of care and attention. Some of those include: 
          <ul id="advanced_list">
            <li>Calathea</li>
            <li>Maidenhair Fern</li>
            <li>Caladium</li>
            <li>Fiddle Leaf Fig</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>These plants require some skill to keep alive. They need lots of bright indirect sunlight, and regular watering schedules, sometimes even misting schedules or a humidifier. These plants are very sensitive to their environment and if they are not getting enought of what they need, even a little, they will die. They do not forgive you for forgetting about them. They are sure beautiful though if you can keep them happy.</p>

        <p>Watering: Good watering practice with your plants is important. All plants need to have good drainage to help prevent overwatering and root rot. When watering your plants, you should be checking the soil to see how moist it still is. You don't want to keep watering if the soil is still soggy. And for most plants you don't want the soil to feel completely dryed out either. When you do water, you need to throughly soak the soil until it starts draining out the bottom of the pot. Then you'll know the plant got a good drink.</p>
        <p>Lighting: Be sure to check what kind of lighting your plant needs and figure out where in your home gets that light. Depending where you live the direction your window faces could play a factor into how much lighting is getting in your house. For example, living here in Utah, windows facing south get the better lighting vs windows facing north. Keep in mind that some houseplants can get sunburned just like us if they get too much direct sun hitting them.</p>
        <p>Space: Plants will continue growing if they are getting the care they need. And usually houseplants are kept in pots. Which means as the plant grows, they will eventually need more room than what they have. If your plant starts to push roots out the bottom of the pot, need water more often (theres so many roots soaking up the water too quickly), or is root bound, then you know it is time to repot. A good rule of thumb when repotting plants is to never repot them in a pot that is bigger than ~2in from the original pot. Planting a plant in a pot that is way to big for it can overwhelm the plant.</p>
        <p>Food: Most plants get their nutrients from the soil they are plantted in. Sometimes though thats not enough for them. You can help your plant out by fertilizing it. Plants need to be fertilized more during their growing season, and less during their more dormant season. Be sure to check when those seasons are for your plants!</p>
